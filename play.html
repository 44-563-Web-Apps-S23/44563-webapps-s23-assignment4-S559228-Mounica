    <h2>HYACINTH HALVEY - Lady Augusta Gregory</h2>
    <p>
        MRS. DELANE. There is the four-o'clock train, Mr. Quirke.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        MR. QUIRKE. Is it now, Mrs. Delane, and I not long after rising? It
        makes a man drowsy to be doing the half of his work in the night-time.
        Going about the country, looking for little stags of sheep, striving to
        knock a few shillings together. That contract for the soldiers gives me
        a great deal to attend to.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        MRS. DELANE. I suppose so. It's hard enough on myself to be down ready
        for the mail-car in the morning, sorting letters in the half-dark. It's
        often I haven't time to look who are the letters from--or the cards.
        
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        MR. QUIRKE. It would be a pity you not to know any little news might be
        knocking about. If you did not have information of what is going on, who
        should have it? Was it you, ma'am, was telling me that the new
        sub-sanitary inspector would be arriving to-day?
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        MRS. DELANE. To-day it is he is coming, and it's likely he was in that
        train. There was a card about him to Sergeant Carden this morning.        
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        MR. QUIRKE. A young chap from Carrow they were saying he was.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        MRS. DELANE. So he is, one Hyacinth Halvey; and indeed if all that is
        said of him is true, or if a quarter of it is true, he will be a credit
        to this town.
